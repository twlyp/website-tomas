        Tomás Eyzaguirre is an in-disciplinary artist who explores corporeality in various
        manifestations of art.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        Emerging from fashion photography, his approach to imagery stems from the creation of
        characters through costume, examining how it transforms the persona and how the body
        structures the attire, thus completing the fantasy. His photography has expanded through a
        process of self-discipline, addressing various areas of this art and applying the same
        concepts, from object intervention to the creation of simple wooden installations that he
        constructs, dresses, photographs, and then dismantles, analyzing the ultimate abstraction of
        corporeality.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        In music, these principles manifest in the search for the corporeality of the voice. Under
        the persona of [Auno], born in an artist residency, Eyzaguirre explored singing inside a
        cave to replicate his ecclesiastical past. The cave’s lack of echo led him to recreate it
        through loudspeakers, resulting in a study of sound waves and physical phenomena that
        defined his vocal style. Working primarily with singing, extended vocal techniques,
        microphones, and amplification, he creates complex sounds and atmospheres filled with
        feedback, transgressing gender conventions and revealing the ambiguous and plastic qualities
        of the voice.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        In drag performance, Eyzaguirre lends his body to [Soyla Tempestad], who intervenes with
        garments found on the street under the concept of "Zu-verschenken" (to give away). Dressed
        in this "armor," Tempestad takes over Tomeyza’s body and performs solo shows.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        His findings emerge from residencies, collaborations, and constant experimentation in
        artistic projects. He defines himself as an in-disciplinary artist due to his
        non-traditional relationship with art, based on self-imposed experimentation, the authority
        of failure, error, intuition, and feedback from his peers.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
